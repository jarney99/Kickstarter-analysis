# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview
Louise is a play writer and she is starting a fund raising campaign for her first play, fever. She is interested in learning what makes a project successful.
### Purpose
We will be analyzing successful and failed project to see where they went wrong, so Louise can try to mirror a successful project. By analyzing the data in excel, we can make the data easier for Louise to decide the direction of her project. She has a budget of over $10,000 so it is important that she knows where to put her money. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed two major factors to determine the outcome of the project. Those two being launch date and fundraising goals. Using this information Louise can determine the best time to start a project and a reasonable goal. 
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch date
Below is the analysis of project outcome based on launch date. From this information we were able to analyze what month is best for releasing a successful project. Successful and failed projects follow a pretty similar path throughout a calendar year. There are more successful projects in every month other than December. Starting with failed projects, we are able to see that it is steady throughout the year, but it makes a jump from about 34 in September, to 50 in October. This tells Louise to stay away from the month of October when deciding when to launch her project. For successful projects there are two jumps. The first being a small jump in February, and the second being a large jump from 71 to 111 in May. Now Louise knows that the best time to launch a project is in May and to avoid October.

### Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
Below is the analysis of outcomes based on fundraising goals. There is no specific pattern for identifying a successful vs failed fundraising campaign, so it helps to be able to look at a line graph. Starting with percentage failed, we can see that there are two major peaks. The smaller of the two is when the fundraising goal is between $20,000 and $24,999, and contines from the goal $25,000 to $29,999. The second major peak has a 100% project failure. That was from projects who's goal was between $40,000 and $44,999. This tells us that we want to avoid goals between $20,000 and $29,999 as well as projects that have goals from $40,000 to $49,999. Successful projects have an inverse relationship with failed projects of course, so we can see that the more successful projects have a higher percentage when requiring a lower goal. There is a 100% success when fundraising goals are $10,000 to $14,999. This tells us the best goal to have for a high chance at success is between $10,000 and $14,999.

### Challenges and difficulties
There weren't many challenges or difficulties encountered seeing that the majority of plays created are successful. A challenge that could affect Louise's project would be our analysis based on fundraising goals. The analysis is based on past projects, so the goals may differ. For some fundraising ranges, there were less than 10 projects being analyzed. For example, for ranges $45,000 to $49,999, there was only 1 project being analyzed, and it happened to have failed. Because of this, that fundraising range has a 100% failure rating. This could be overcome by analyzing more projects to get more accurate data, or just by focusing on less fundraising ranges. 
## Results
As we saw earlier, the best time of the year to start a project is in the summer months, specifically May. While the best times to avoid starting a project is in the winter months, especially October. There are more successful projects than failed projects, so although there are peak months for starting projects, we can also conclude there is a high chance the project will be successful.
We can also conclude that the best goal for fundraising will be between $10,000 and $14,999 since there was a 100% success rate with projects between those ranges. 
Although there is a 100% success rate between those ranges, we are limited based on the data provided for us. In order to have full confidence in a fundraising goal we should analyze more data sets. We could also have other graphs and tables, for example we could use the location of the project to determine where the most successful projects are.
