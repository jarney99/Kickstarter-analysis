# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview
Louise is a play writer and she is starting a fund raising campaign for her first play, fever. She is interested in learning what makes a project successful.
### Purpose
We will be analyzing successful and failed project to see where they went wrong, so Louise can try to mirror a successful project. By analyzing the data in excel, we can make the data easier for Louise to decide the direction of her project. She has a budget of over $10,000 so it is important that she knows where to put her money. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed two major factors to determine the outcome of the project. Those two being launch date and fundraising goals. Using this information Louise can determine the best time to start a project and a reasonable goal. 
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch date
Below is the analysis of project outcome based on launch date. From this information we were able to analyze what month is best for releasing a successful project. Successful and failed projects follow a pretty similar path throughout a calendar year. There are more successful projects in every month other than December. Starting with failed projects, we are able to see that it is steady throughout the year, but it makes a jump from about 34 in September, to 50 in October. This tells Louise to stay away from the month of October when deciding when to launch her project. For successful projects there are two jumps. The first being a small jump in February, and the second being a large jump from 71 to 111 in May.
